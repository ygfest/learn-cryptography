          Cryptography involves concealing or encoding information to ensure
          that only the intended recipient of a message can comprehend it. This
          ancient practice has been employed for millennia and persists in
          applications such as bank cards, computer passwords, and e-commerce.
          Contemporary cryptographic methods utilize algorithms and ciphers,
          including encryption keys like 128-bit and 256-bit, facilitating the
          secure encoding and decoding of information. Advanced ciphers, like
          the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), are widely regarded as nearly
          impervious to decryption attempts. Cryptography, often defined as
          encoding information to restrict access to the designated recipient,
          is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity known as cryptology. This
          interdisciplinary field combines computer science, engineering, and
          mathematics to craft intricate codes that obscure the true meaning of
          a message.

          Brief History of Cryptography
        </h4>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          The history of cryptography spans thousands of years, dating back to
          ancient civilizations. Early techniques, such as substitution ciphers,
          were used for secret communication. Ancient Egyptians employed
          hieroglyphics, while ancient Greece utilized the scytale for military
          communication. In the Middle Ages, polyalphabetic ciphers emerged,
          with figures like Leon Battista Alberti contributing innovations. The
          20th century introduced devices like the Enigma machine, and
          public-key cryptography in the 1970s revolutionized secure
          communication. Today, cryptography safeguards online transactions,
          sensitive data, and digital privacy. Its evolution continues as
          technology advances and new cybersecurity challenges arise.
